# RustNN

RustNN is a Rust-based neural network library built on top of the powerful [ndarray](https://github.com/rust-ndarray/ndarray) library. It provides a straightforward implementation of classic neural network architectures, making it ideal for learning, experimentation, and developing a deeper understanding of how neural networks function under the hood.

## Features

- Easy-to-use neural network layers and operations

- Built on ndarray, providing efficient numerical computations

- Ideal for learning and educational purposes

- Minimal dependencies, leveraging the power of Rustâ€™s ownership model and performance

## Purpose

RustNN was created as a personal project by a senior data science student aiming to:

- Develop proficiency in Rust programming

- Gain an in-depth understanding of neural networks by building them from scratch

- Showcase practical Rust coding skills and neural network knowledge
